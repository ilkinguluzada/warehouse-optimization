# Task

Write a function, calculateBestGrouping, which takes an array of Products and returns an equal length array of WarehouseDistances.

The function must select the best warehouse for each product, according to this criteria:
It must use as few different warehouses as possible (if one grouping would have 3 different warehouses and the other one 2, the latter would be selected)

Out of the fewest warehouse options, select the one with the smallest distanceToConsumer summed across all products.
